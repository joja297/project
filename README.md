# project

Hello,

so currently it is two devided pages. 
One of them is representing webshop. Every item could be picked, button wiev is not in function yet. Every picked item would be shown in cart where you can increase or decrease amount or if u want to clear cart, just press "clear all" button.

Login function would be connected with login page.

Login page is responsive page where person could sign in or sign up and then wisit webpage.

Every product on "view" button would have some kind od list or table, responsive and observable, with edit option.

This is only demo version with design that would help to orient easier. Those multiple pages would be connected in single page applicanio with react.

-that is what is builted and plan what else need to d. :)



Week two...

Build an SPA and table application.
-SPA is simple 3 view application with Dashboard,Posts and Settings...After combining all Html components and SPA with table, it should have Login,Webshop and 'table' view.
-Table application with lot of function like sorting paging filtering and so on.
Next step would be connecting all of these steps into one application.

Everyday getting closer to the finish line but it gets harder from day to day. Managed to learn a lot in short time. Hoping that I wil manage to achieve what I plan to do.
