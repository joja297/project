Hello,

so currently it is two devided pages. 
One of them is representing webshop. Every item could be picked, button wiev is not in function yet. Every picked item would be shown in cart where you can increase or decrease amount or if u want to clear cart, just press "clear all" button.

Login function would be connected with login page.

Login page is responsive page where person could sign in or sign up and then wisit webpage.

Every product on "view" button would have some kind od list or table, responsive and observable, with edit option.

This is only demo version with design that would help to orient easier. Those multiple pages would be connected in single page applicanio with react.

-that is what is builted and plan what else need to d. :)
